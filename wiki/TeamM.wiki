 Shape Reconstruction 

Reconstructing a Gielis curve can be posed as a minimization problem of a cost function. For this, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for Least Square Minimization of Nonlinear Models is required.

= Questions =
|| || *Question* || *Answer* ||
||1|| Why do we use Potential Field? || It is used to know whether a point lies outside, inside or on the boundary of the curve. ||
||2|| What is the physical significance of Cost Function? || It gives the overall deviation of the detected contour points from the Gielis curve.  ||
||3|| What is the basic principle behind 'Curve fitting algorithm'? ||In simple terms Curve fitting or reconstruction of Gielis curve is posed as a minimization problem of the corresponding cost function, which is the underlying principal used in this algorithm. ||
