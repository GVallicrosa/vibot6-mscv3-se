= Questions =
|| || *Questions* || *Answers*||
|| 1 || Why is Testing stage important in software engineering? || A primary purpose of testing is to check if the software works properly, and to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected.||

|| 2 || What are levels of testing in our project? || *a Unit Testing :-* Unit Testing is done at the lowest level.Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use.In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure.In object-oriented programming a unit is usually an interface, such as a class. Unit tests are generally created by programmers. *b Integration Testing :-*Integration Testing is performed when two or more tested units are combined into a larger structure. 
The test is often done on both the interfaces between the components and the larger structure being constructed. *c System Testing :-* System Testing tends to affirm the end-to-end quality of the entire system. System test is often based on the functional/requirement specification of the system. Non-functional quality attributes, such as reliability, security, and maintainability, are also checked. ||

|| 3 || *What testing approach will we use in our project?* || We will use bottom up approach i.e. we begin from unit/component testing to system testing (integration testing). For Integration test, first we use black box approach with Valantineâ€™s data set. If required, then we go for white box (in the case black box fails).|| 

|| 4 || *What are Defect testing and validation testing ?* || a.Defect Testing :- Tests designed to reveal the presence of defects in a system. b. Validation Testing :- Tests designed to show that the software meets its requirements. ||

===5. Which GUI environment are we using in our project ?===
We are using Qt for developing GUI in C++. Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface.

For GUI in matlab,we are using the GUIDE Toolbox.
