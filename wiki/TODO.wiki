#summary What is left to be done

= Introduction =

Here is the list of what still needs to be done for our project. Please update this page accordingly.


= C++ =
 * GUI
  ** Options (Having the same options as Matlab).
  ** QT Settings (Global variable = Matlab)
  ** Getting rid of the the confirmation questions. Currently for each step it asks whether user is sure.
  ** Saving output images.
  ** Saving logs. (For each step saved the information in a txt file, empty line can be used for separation of data in a file.) (The Matlab part is implemented, please refer to that for guideline.)
  ** When no image is selected and process button is pressed, application crashes.
  ** Keeping the image folder path.
  ** A button for process all the loaded images.

 * Compilation
  ** Windows compilation.
  ** No button is displayed when its compiled with cmake, although when it's compiled with qmake, it works fine.

 * Detection
  ** For many images the final output is wrong (it becomes like leafs of a flower).
  ** For some images the output although correct but is much smaller than the road sign.
