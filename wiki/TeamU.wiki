In this meeting we discussed on how the Shape Reconstruction functions are used in the code, how to determine the number of variables relevant to the functions. Then we discussed on how to divide the task among members based on those variables.

In this meeting we decided to analyse the code together and discuss the low-level design of the functions. We continued the previous analysis of the functions, along with their relevant variables and how they are used in the functions. We've also figured out the input/output parameters of each functions and added header texts for each one too.

Beginning of clean up & coding of the functions relevant to the shape reconstruction part of the thesis. The function RobustInit has been ported to Matlab. Other functions are still being ported. For more details please see the respective meeting log above.
