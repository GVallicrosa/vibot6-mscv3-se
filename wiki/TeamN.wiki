= Questions =
|| || *Question* || *Answer* ||
||1|| Why is High Level Design important in Software Engineering? || A high-level design provides an overview of the whole system and it is important to make sure that each supporting component design will be compatible with its neighboring designs and with the big picture.||
||2|| What is contained in each HLD block? || Each block specifies the input, objective (responsibility) and output of the block.||
||3|| What was the basis for creating the general HLD flowchart?|| The HLD flowchart was created parting from Valentine's thesis, where the algorithm was analyzed and represented as a flowchart ||
||4|| Does HLD contain algorithm to obtain the goal of that block || Yes it breaks the problem into simple blocks which are well know steps and provides the sense of flow among these blocks. This forms the base for LLD as well ||
||5|| How is the High Level Design arranged in our project? || The HLD is arranged by functional blocks and one flow diagram describing the links and order between blocks. There is one block for each part of the algorithm.||
