#summary Covering technicality of OpenGL.

= Introduction =
In this page we try to cover OpenGL technical issues. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL Open Graphics Library (OpenGL)] is a standard specification defining a cross-language, cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics.


= Details =
Coming soon. :)

== Installation ==
In this section we cover how to install OpenGL in your machine step by step.


=== Code Blocks ===
Since it seems must of the people have been manipulated by using the Code Blocks, I tried first to install glut for that IDE.

 # Download glut-3.7.6-bin from this link.
 # Copy glut32.dll to c:\windows\system,
 # Copy glut32.lib to C:\Program Files (x86)\Code Blocks\MinGW\lib (The path might be different on your machine, but very similar to this one, depending on the Windows you're using.)
 # Copy glut.h to c:\Program Files (x86)\Code Blocks\MinGW\include\GL.

It's not yet fully done, more things need to be fixed in the code, will write it in the morning.

=== Eigen ==
In order to use Eigen, you just need to download and extract Eigen's source code (see the wiki for download instructions). In fact, the header files in the Eigen subdirectory are the only files required to compile programs using Eigen. The header files are the same for all platforms. It is not necessary to use CMake or install anything.

*This is not related to OpenGL, but necessary to compile the code we got for the project, I'm going to migrate it tomorrow to somewhere more approperiate.*
