= Activity =
1.1 Block is currently implemented in MATLAB, we have to implement it complete in C++.

1.2 Team decided to make LLD of the basic functionalities of the block first and then we will work on possible improvements like occlusion issue..

1.3 KT is planned on 22nd Oct.

1.4 Saurabh and Raquel are going to share KT on all the concepts related to Geilis Curves, rotational offsets.

2.1 Cause sometimes the first minimum theta doesn't work for the gielius curve, we need to use several minimum thetas, namely, passing thetas in an array.

2.2 Talked about creating a class which has the similar writing for pointersï¼Œ functions, etc.

2.3 Raquel will send us the mathematical & complicated(not for her -.-) notes about rotational offset.

2.4 Next meeting we will make sure how our function(and class) should be like.
