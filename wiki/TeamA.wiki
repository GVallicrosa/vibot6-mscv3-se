= Questions =
|| || *Question* || *Answer* ||
||1|| Is C++ Object Oriented Language? || Yes ||
||2|| What is the advantage of Makefiles? || When you have many .cpp files it is not necessary to recompile all the files when you make changes. Using Makefiles you can recompile a small subset of the files. ||
||3|| What does OpenGL stand for? || Open Graphics Library ||
||4|| Please give a name of library that agree with OpenGL. || OpenGL Utility Library (GLU), OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT), OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) ||
