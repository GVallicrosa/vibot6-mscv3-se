= Questions =
|| || *Question* || *Answer* ||
||1|| What is the purpose of post processing? || To remove artifacts in the image that we know in advance that cannot be road signs. ||
||2|| What is the strategy of noise removal? || Morphological filtering and using the median filter||
||3|| Why is a convex hull algorithm performed? || To extract an approximate convex polygon from the segmented section. We know that all road signs are convex polygons.||
