# Questions #
| | **Questions** | **Answers**|
|:|:--------------|:-----------|
| 1 | **Why is Testing stage important in software engineering?**     | A primary purpose of testing is to check if the software works properly, and to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected.|
| 2 | **What are levels of testing in our project?**                  | **a) Unit Testing :-** Unit Testing is done at the lowest level. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming a unit is usually an interface,such as a class. For our case the individual matlab function or a C++ class  may be the **unit** for this type of test. Unit tests are generally created by programmers.<br><b>b) Integration Testing :-</b>Integration Testing is performed when two or more tested units are combined into a larger structure. In our case it may can be done when we call function(s) from other function.e.g when we combine rotation offset with shape reconstruction. <br><b>c) System Testing :-</b> System Testing tends to affirm the end-to-end quality of the entire system. System test is often based on the functional/requirement specification of the system. For our case it is done when entire software is ready. <br>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td> <b>What testing approach will we use in our project?</b>           </td><td>  We will use bottom up approach i.e. we begin from unit/component testing to system testing (integration testing). For Integration test, first we use black box approach with Valantineâ€™s data set. If required, then we go for white box (in the case black box fails).</td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td> <b>What are Defect testing and validation testing ?</b>            </td><td> <b>a) Defect Testing :-</b> Tests designed to reveal the presence of defects in a system. <br><b>b) Validation Testing :-</b> Tests designed to show that the software meets its requirements. </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 </td><td> <b>Which GUI environment are we using in our project ?</b>         </td><td> We are using Qt for developing GUI in C++. Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface. For GUI in matlab,we are using the GUIDE Toolbox. </td></tr></tbody></table>
