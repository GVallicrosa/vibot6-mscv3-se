## Introduction ##

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real time computer vision, developed by Intel. It is free for use under the open source BSD license. The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing.

For this project we used OpenCV mainly for segmentation objectives.

## Installation Guide ##

The version used for this project is OpenCV 2.2.

### Official Guide ###

#### Windows ####
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/MinGW#OpenCV2.2

This guide will tell you how to install the OpenCV 2.2 library. It is designed to use OpenCV on Windows and Code::Blocks. Nevertheless, you may also use Qt after using this guide, you only need to tell Qt where the library is.

##### Known Issues #####

For Windows XP, after successful compilation of the library your program might crash. If so, go to:
